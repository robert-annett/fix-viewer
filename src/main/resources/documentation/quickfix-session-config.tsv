StartTime	Time of day that this FIX session becomes activated	time in the format of HH:MM:SS [timezone]. The time zone is optional. The TimeZone setting will be used, if set, or UTC will be used by default. The timezone string should be one that the Java TimeZone class can resolve. For example, "15:00:00 US/Central".	
EndTime	Time of day that this FIX session becomes deactivated	time in the format of HH:MM:SS [timezone]. The time zone is optional. The TimeZone setting will be used, if set, or UTC will be used by default. The timezone string should be one that the Java TimeZone class can resolve. For example, "09:00:00 US/Eastern".

NonStopSession	If set the session will never reset. This is effectively the same as setting 00:00:00 as StartTime and EndTime.	Y N	N
TimeStampPrecision	Determines precision for timestamps in (Orig)SendingTime fields. Only available for FIX.4.2 and greater. NB: This configuration is only considered for messages that are sent out. QuickFIX/J is able to receive UtcTimestamp fields with up to picosecond precision. Please note however that only up to nanosecond precision will be stored, i.e. the picoseconds will be truncated.	One of SECONDS MILLIS MICROS NANOS	MILLIS
ClosedResendInterval	Use actual end of sequence gap for resend requests rather than using "infinity" as the end sequence of the gap. Not recommended by the FIX specification, but needed for some counterparties.	Y N	N
UseDataDictionary	Tell session whether or not to expect a data dictionary. You should always use a DataDictionary if you are using repeating groups.	Y N	Y
DataDictionary	XML definition file for validating incoming FIX messages. If no DataDictionary is supplied, only basic message validation will be done This setting should only be used with FIX transport versions old than FIXT 1.1. See TransportDataDictionary and ApplicationDataDictionary for FIXT 1.1 settings.	Valid XML data dictionary file, QuickFIX/J comes with the following defaults in the etc directory: FIXT11.xml, FIX50.xml, FIX44.xml, FIX43.xml, FIX42.xml, FIX41.xml, FIX40.xml.	If DataDictionary is not specified and UseDataDictionary=Y, then QuickFIX/J will look for a default dictionary based on the session's BeginString (e.g., FIX.4.2 = FIX42.xml). The DataDictionary file search strategy is to use a URL, then the file system, and then the thread context classloader (if any), and then the DataDictionary instance's classloader. Default data dictionary files are included in the QuickFIX/J jar file.
TransportDataDictionary	Valid XML data dictionary file path.	If no dictionary path is supplied, an attempt will be made to load a default transport dictionary.	
AppDataDictionary	Valid XML data dictionary file path.	If no dictionary path is supplied, an attempt will be made to load a dictionary using the DefaultApplVerID for the session.	
ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder	If set to N, fields that are out of order (i.e. body fields in the header, or header fields in the body) will not be rejected. Useful for connecting to systems which do not properly order fields.	Y N	Y
ValidateFieldsHaveValues	If set to N, fields without values (empty) will not be rejected. Useful for connecting to systems which improperly send empty tags.	Y N	Y
ValidateUserDefinedFields	If set to N, user defined fields (field with tag >= 5000) will not be rejected if they are not defined in the data dictionary, or are present in messages they do not belong to.	Y N	Y
ValidateUnorderedGroupFields	Session validation setting for enabling whether field ordering is * validated. Values are "Y" or "N". Default is "Y".	Y N	Y
FirstFieldInGroupIsDelimiter	Session validation setting for enabling whether first found field in repeating group will be used as delimiter. Values are "Y" or "N". Default is "N". ValidateUnorderedGroupFields should be set to "N"	Y N	N
ValidateIncomingMessage	Allow to bypass the message validation (against the dictionary). Default is "Y".	Y N	Y
ValidateSequenceNumbers	Check the next expected target SeqNum against the received SeqNum. Default is "Y". If enabled and a mismatch is detected, apply the following logic: if lower than expected SeqNum , logout if higher, send a resend request If not enabled and a mismatch is detected, nothing is done. Must be enabled for EnableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum to work.	Y N	Y
ValidateChecksum	If ValidateChecksum is set to N, checksum validation will not be executed on messages. This setting cannot be set to N together with RejectGarbledMessage set to Y, in this case Config Error will be thrown.	Y N	Y
AllowUnknownMsgFields	Y N	N	
CheckCompID	If set to Y, messages must be received from the counterparty with the correct SenderCompID and TargetCompID. Some systems will send you different CompIDs by design, so you must set this to N.	Y N	Y
CheckLatency	If set to Y, messages must be received from the counterparty within a defined number of seconds (see MaxLatency). It is useful to turn this off if a system uses localtime for its timestamps instead of GMT.	Y N	Y
MaxLatency	If CheckLatency is set to Y, this defines the number of seconds latency allowed for a message to be processed.	positive integer	120
RejectGarbledMessage	If RejectGarbledMessage is set to Y, garbled messages will be rejected (with a generic error message in 58/Text field) instead of ignored. This is only working for messages that pass the FIX decoder and reach the engine. Messages that cannot be considered a real FIX message (i.e. not starting with 8=FIX or not ending with 10=xxx) will be ignored in any case. See Invalid vs Garbled Messages for further explanation.	Y N	N
RejectInvalidMessage	If RejectInvalidMessage is set to N, only a warning will be logged on reception of message that fails data dictionary validation. See Invalid vs Garbled Messages for further explanation.	Y N	Y
RejectMessageOnUnhandledException	If this configuration is enabled, an uncaught Exception or Error in the application's message processing will lead to a (BusinessMessage)Reject being sent to the counterparty and the incoming message sequence number will be incremented. If disabled (default), the problematic incoming message is discarded and the message sequence number is not incremented. Processing of the next valid message will cause detection of a sequence gap and a ResendRequest will be generated.	Y N	N
RequiresOrigSendingTime	If RequiresOrigSendingTime is set to N, PossDup messages lacking that field will not be rejected.	Y N	Y
ReconnectInterval	Time between reconnection attempts in seconds. Only used for initiators	positive integer	30

EndpointIdentificationAlgorithm	Sets the endpoint identification algorithm. If the algorithm parameter is non-null, the endpoint identification/verification procedures must be handled during SSL/TLS handshaking. See Endpoint Identification Algorithm Names		
UseSNI	Enables the SSL engine to use Server Name Indication (SNI). This option is only applicable for initiators. If provided, SNIHostName will be used as the server name. Otherwise, SocketConnectHost or SocketConnectHost<n> will be used. Note: When this option is disabled, the JVM may still implicitly send the SSL server_name extension.	Y N	N
SNIHostName	SNI host name to be used as desired Server Name Indication (SNI) parameter.

SocketKeepAlive	When the keepalive option is set for a TCP socket and no data has been exchanged across the socket in either direction for 2 hours (NOTE: the actual value is implementation dependent), TCP automatically sends a keepalive probe to the peer. This probe is a TCP segment to which the peer must respond. One of three responses is expected: The peer responds with the expected ACK. The application is not notified (since everything is OK). TCP will send another probe following another 2 hours of inactivity. The peer responds with an RST, which tells the local TCP that the peer host has crashed and rebooted. The socket is closed. There is no response from the peer. The socket is closed. The purpose of this option is to detect if the peer host crashes.	Y N	
SocketOobInline	When the OOBINLINE option is set, any TCP urgent data received on the socket will be received through the socket input stream. When the option is disabled (which is the default) urgent data is silently discarded.	Y N	
SocketReceiveBufferSize	Set a hint the size of the underlying buffers used by the platform for incoming network I/O. When used in set, this is a suggestion to the kernel from the application about the size of buffers to use for the data to be received over the socket.	Integer value.	
SocketReuseAddress	Sets SO_REUSEADDR for a socket. This is used only for MulticastSockets in java, and it is set by default for MulticastSockets.	Y N	
SocketSendBufferSize	Set a hint the size of the underlying buffers used by the platform for outgoing network I/O. When used in set, this is a suggestion to the kernel from the application about the size of buffers to use for the data to be sent over the socket.	Integer value.	
SocketLinger	Specify a linger-on-close timeout. This option disables/enables immediate return from a close() of a TCP Socket. Enabling this option with a non-zero Integer timeout means that a close() will block pending the transmission and acknowledgement of all data written to the peer, at which point the socket is closed gracefully. Upon reaching the linger timeout, the socket is closed forcefully, with a TCP RST. Enabling the option with a timeout of zero does a forceful close immediately. If the specified timeout value exceeds 65,535 it will be reduced to 65,535.	Integer value.	
SocketTcpNoDelay	Disable Nagle's algorithm for this connection. Written data to the network is not buffered pending acknowledgement of previously written data.	Y N	Y
SocketTrafficClass	Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP header for packets sent from this Socket. As the underlying network implementation may ignore this value applications should consider it a hint. The tc must be in the range 0 ≤ tc ≤ 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. Notes: for Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an octet with precedence and TOS fields as detailed in RFC 1349. The TOS field is bitset created by bitwise-or'ing values such the following :- IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02) IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04) IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08) IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10) The last low order bit is always ignored as this corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit. Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a SocketException indicating that the operation is not permitted.	An integer value or a set of string options separated by "|" (e.g., "IPTOS_LOWCOST|IPTOS_LOWDELAY")	
SocketSynchronousWrites	Write messages synchronously. This is not generally recommended as it may result in performance degradation. The MINA communication layer is asynchronous by design, but this option will override that behavior if needed.	Y N	N
SocketSynchronousWriteTimeout	The time in milliseconds to wait for a write to complete.	Integer.	30000 ms (30 seconds) if SocketSynchronousWrites is "Y".
MaxScheduledWriteRequests	Number of scheduled write requests on which session is forcefully disconnected.	positive Integer.	0 (disabled)
PersistMessages	If set to N, no messages will be persisted. This will force QFJ to always send GapFills instead of resending messages. Use this if you know you never want to resend a message. Useful for market data streams.	Y N	Y
FileStorePath	Directory to store sequence number and message files. Only used with FileStoreFactory.	valid directory for storing files, must have write access	
FileStoreMaxCachedMsgs	Maximum number of message index entries to cache in memory.	Integer. A zero will not cache any entries.	10000
FileStoreSync	Whether the FileStore syncs to the hard drive on every write. It's safer to sync, but it's also much slower.	Y N	N
JdbcDataSourceName	JNDI name for the JDBC data source. This technique for finding the data source can be used as an alternative to specifying the driver details. It allows better integration with application servers and servlet containers that are already configured with JDBC data sources.	JNDI name of the data source. Configuration of the initial context must be done by an application server, through a property file or through system properties. See JNDI documentation for more information.	
JdbcDriver	JDBC driver for JDBC logger. Also used for JDBC log.	Class name for the JDBC driver. Specify driver properties directly will cause the creation of a HikariCP data source that supports connection pooling. If you are using a database with its own pooling data source (e.g., Oracle) then use the setDataSource() method on the Jdbc-related factories to set the data source directly.	
JdbcLogIncomingTable	The name of the JDBC log incoming table.	valid table name	messages_log
JdbcLogOutgoingTable	The name of the JDBC log outgoing table.	valid table name	messages_log
JdbcLogEventTable	The name of the JDBC log events table.	valid table name	event_log
JdbcSessionIdDefaultPropertyValue	The default value for Session ID bean properties is an empty string. Oracle treats this as a SQL NULL and that causes problems. This configuration setting allows you to set the default value for unspecified Session ID properties.	Any nonempty string.	"" (empty string)
JdbcMaxActiveConnection	Specifies the maximum number of connections to the database.	Positive number	32
JdbcMinIdleConnection	Controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool, including both idle and in-use connections. If the idle connections dip below this value, HikariCP will make the best effort to restore them quickly and efficiently.	[0, JdbcMaxActiveConnection]	Same as JdbcMaxActiveConnection
JdbcMaxConnectionLifeTime	Specifies the maximum amount of time that a connection exists for before it is killed (milliseconds).	Positive	28800000 ms (8 hours)
JdbcConnectionTimeout	Set the maximum number of milliseconds that a client will wait for a connection from the pool. If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, an SQLException will be thrown from javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection().	Non-negative number	250 ms
JdbcConnectionIdleTimeout	Controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. Whether a connection is retired as idle or not is subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average variation of +15 seconds. A connection will never be retired as idle before this timeout. A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the pool.	Non-negative number	600000 ms (10 minutes)
JdbcConnectionKeepaliveTime	Controls the keepalive interval for a connection in the pool. An in-use connection will never be tested by the keepalive thread, only when it is idle will it be tested.	Non-negative number	0 ms
JdbcConnectionTestQuery	Set the SQL query to be executed to test the validity of connections. Using the JDBC4 Connection.isValid() method to test connection validity can be more efficient on some databases and is recommended. If your driver supports JDBC4 we strongly recommend not setting this property.	Valid SQL query	
FileLogPath	Directory to store logs. Only used with FileLogFactory.	valid directory for storing files, must have write access	
FileLogHeartbeats	Controls logging of heartbeat messages.	Y N	N
FileIncludeMilliseconds	Controls whether milliseconds are included in log time stamps.	Y N	N
FileIncludeTimeStampForMessages	Controls whether time stamps are included on message log entries.	Y N	N
SLF4JLogEventCategory	Log category for logged events.	Depends on log engine. The SLF4J adapter for JDK 1.4 logging is included by default. An adapter for Log4J and the Log4J JAR are in the lib/optional directory. See slf4j.org for other options. The SLF4J category options support Session ID variables in the category names. The variables are: ${fixMajorVersion} ${fixMinorVersion} ${senderCompID} ${targetCompID} ${qualifier} For example, a category value "${senderCompID}.events" (without the quotes) would become "BANZAI.events" in the log file if BANZAI is the senderCompID for the session. This can be used with advanced logging libraries like Log4J to create sophisticated session-specific logging policies.	quickfixj.event
SLF4JLogIncomingMessageCategory	Log category for incoming messages.	Depends on log engine. See "SL4JLogEventCategory".	quickfixj.msg.incoming
SLF4JLogOutgoingMessageCategory	Log category for outgoing messages.	Depends on log engine. See "SL4JLogEventCategory".	quickfixj.msg.outgoing
SLF4JLogHeartbeats	Controls whether heartbeats are logged.	Y N	N
ScreenLogShowIncoming	Log incoming messages to screen.	Y N	Y
ScreenLogShowOutgoing	Log outgoing messages to screen.	Y N	Y
ScreenLogShowHeartBeats	Filter heartbeats from output (both incoming and outgoing)	Y N	N
LogonTag	Tag/value pair which will be set on sent Logon message.	<tag>=<value>, where "tag" has to be a positive integer and "value" a String Example: LogonTag=553=foo	
LogonTag<n>	Additional tag/value pairs which will be set on sent Logon message, where n is a positive integer, i.e. LogonTag1, LogonTag2, etc. Must be consecutive.	<tag>=<value>, where "tag" has to be a positive integer and "value" a String Example: LogonTag=553=user LogonTag1=554=password	
RefreshOnLogon	Refresh the session state when a Logon is received. This allows a simple form of failover when the message store data is persistent. The option will be ignored for message stores that are not persistent (e.g., MemoryStore).	Y N	N
ResetOnLogon	Determines if sequence numbers should be reset before sending/receiving a logon request.	Y N	N
ResetOnLogout	Determines if sequence numbers should be reset to 1 after a normal logout termination.	Y N	N
ResetOnDisconnect	Determines if sequence numbers should be reset to 1 after an abnormal termination.	Y N	N
ResetOnError	Session setting for doing an automatic reset when an error occurs. A reset means disconnect, sequence numbers reset, store cleaned and reconnect, as for a daily reset.	Y N	N
DisconnectOnError	Session setting for doing an automatic disconnect when an error occurs.	Y N	N
EnableLastMsgSeqNumProcessed	Add tag LastMsgSeqNumProcessed in the header (optional tag 369).	Y N	N
EnableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum	Add tag NextExpectedMsgSeqNum (optional tag 789) on the sent Logon message and use value of tag 789 on received Logon message to synchronize session. This should not be enabled for FIX versions < 4.4. Only works when ValidateSequenceNumbers is enabled.	Y N	N
ResendRequestChunkSize	Setting to limit the size of a resend request in case of missing messages. This is useful when the remote FIX engine does not allow to ask for more than n message for a ResendRequest. It also allows you to prevent a 'self-DDOS' by accidentally requesting a huge flood of messages your system isn't capable of processing if you are substantially behind for some reason. E.g. if the ResendRequestChunkSize is set to 5 and a gap of 7 messages is detected, a first resend request will be sent for 5 messages. When this gap has been filled, another resend request for 2 messages will be sent. If the ResendRequestChunkSize is set to 0, only one ResendRequest for all the missing messages will be sent.	any positive integer	0 (disables splitting)
ContinueInitializationOnError	Continue initializing sessions if an error occurs. Useful when having multiple sessions per connector and misconfigured session(s) should not prevent the connector from starting.	Y N	N
SendRedundantResendRequests	Allows sending of redundant resend requests.	Y N	N
TestRequestDelayMultiplier	Fraction of the heartbeat interval which defines the additional time to wait if a TestRequest sent after a missing heartbeat times out (final coefficient value is equal to TestRequestDelayMultiplier + 1.0).	any non-negative value	0.5
HeartBeatTimeoutMultiplier	Fraction of the heartbeat interval which defines the additional time to wait since the last message was received before disconnecting (final coefficient value is equal to HeartBeatTimeoutMultiplier + 1.0).	any non-negative value	1.4
DisableHeartBeatCheck	Heartbeat detection is disabled. A disconnect due to a missing heartbeat will never occur.	Y N	N
LogMessageWhenSessionNotFound	Log the entire message when the corresponding session can not be found. Otherwise only the SessionID is logged.	Y N	Y
AllowPosDup	Whether to allow PossDupFlag and OrigSendingTime when sending messages. This is useful on occasions, primarily when a QFJ application is acting as purely a pass-through/monitoring hop.	Y N	N
